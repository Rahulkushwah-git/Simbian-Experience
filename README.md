# Simbian Experience

This is a basic implementation of the **Simbian Experience** UI hosted at: [https://simbian-experience-4eoa.vercel.app/](https://simbian-experience-4eoa.vercel.app/)  
GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/Rahulkushwah-git/Simbian-Experience.git](https://github.com/Rahulkushwah-git/Simbian-Experience.git)

The current version includes a minimal setup using **Next.js** with animations handled via the **Framer Motion** library. While not all features from the original spec are implemented, this version represents a foundational layout with basic UI interactions and transitions. My focus was on quickly getting something functional up and deployed, keeping responsiveness and simple component structure in mind.

### Notes:
- The animation library used is **Framer Motion**, though not all of its advanced features were applied.
- Some UI/UX and functional aspects are missing, mainly due to limited familiarity with certain parts of the tech stack.
- With an additional 7â€“8 days, I am confident I can dive deeper into the stack, refine the UI, and implement the full feature set as required.

---

### ðŸ”§ Known Issues / Potential Improvements:
- The current UI lacks full responsiveness and polish.
- Deeper integrations with animations, advanced layout transitions, and state management are still in progress.
- Some features are placeholders for now and will be built as I continue learning the full tech stack.

Thank you for checking out the project!
